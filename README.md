# Research_Collaborations_CA_Asia


This project was inspired by a take-home-assignment in an job interview. In August, I took an interview with the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. They gave me a take-home-assignment which is to write some brief project thoughts to explore the research collaborations between Canada ans Asia. After learning the data source, building my domain knowledge in research collaborations, and investigating the standardized methodology for data validation, I wrote a detailed project proposal. 

During the process, I got very interested in the project because I found this is a project I could finished by my own and put into my resume. Also, I got very reliable data source so I am confident that I can do it! 

I built a pipeline with python to use API to retrieve the data from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/). And then I validated the data and removed the unreliable records.

In the future, I will transform the json data into structured data frame for further exploration.
